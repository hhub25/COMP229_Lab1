                <h2 class="blueback">MISSION STATEMENT</h2>

                <h2 class="blueback">PROFILE</h2>
                <p align="justify">Hetvi Prajapati has been passionate about real estate since her earliest years growing up in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Hetvi always knew that she wanted to chart a path helping others and found her true calling in real estate serving her clients and guiding them through one of the biggest investments of their lives. Over the past decade, Shannon has been involved in the sales and marketing of $1 billion of real estate in Western Canada and has won awards including the President’s Club Award (representing the Top 1% of all Vancouver Realtors) and the Medallion Club Award. Hetvi feels incredibly blessed to work with amazing clients who become her friends and a strong part of her network.
                    Passionate about real estate investment, Hetvi is an active investor in Western Canada’s emerging real estate markets and shares this knowledge and experience to assist and educate aspiring investors with their goals.

                <h2 class="blueback">CUSTOMER FEEDBACK</h2>
                <p align="justify">Through the purchasing and selling of my parents’ many properties and some of my own, I have met many realtors in my life. Regardless of state borders, what I am usually faced with in a Realtor is unprofessionalism, impatience, and money-driven without your rights as a seller/buyer in mind. Meeting Hetvi was like finally able to breathe after being suffocated for so long. 
                <p align="justify">Hetvi was immensely patient with our seemingly endless questions. They asked questions on our behalf that we didn’t think of to make sure the home we were touring didn’t have hidden issues or was updated to code by licensed individuals/companies. Once we got into escrow, Hetvi was diligent in making sure all inspections were in place, communicated with the seller’s agent, and kept us informed on a daily basis.</p>
                <p align="justify">I am not sure how you can have a better agent than Hetvi and their entire team. If we ever need to sell our current home, we know exactly who to call when the time comes.</p>
